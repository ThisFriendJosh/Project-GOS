# machines, policy (Î·), path math
r"""CATMA engine.

This module provides small utilities to model *machines* (finite state
machines), evaluate a policy :math:`\eta` on those machines and perform basic
path mathematics.  The goal is not to be feature complete but to supply the
minimal capabilities needed by the tests in this kata.

The public API intentionally mirrors common terminology used in the project::

    >>> m = Machine(start="A", transitions={"A": {"x": "B"}, "B": {}})
    >>> def policy(state, action):
    ...     return 0.5
    >>> evaluate_path(m, ["x"], policy)
    0.5

The functions are small but well documented and type hinted to make them easy
to reason about during experimentation.
