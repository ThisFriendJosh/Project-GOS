"""Game engine for strategy and payoff analysis.

This module implements a small normal–form game engine.  Games are defined
by their players, the strategies available to each player and a payoff matrix
that specifies the outcome for every strategy profile.  The engine provides a
best‑response solver that can be used to compute optimal strategies against a
fixed strategy profile of the opponents.

Example
-------

>>> players = ["Alice", "Bob"]
>>> strategies = {"Alice": ["C", "D"], "Bob": ["C", "D"]}
>>> payoffs = {
...     ("C", "C"): (-1, -1),
...     ("C", "D"): (-3, 0),
...     ("D", "C"): (0, -3),
...     ("D", "D"): (-2, -2),
... }
>>> game = Game(players, strategies, payoffs)
>>> game.best_response("Alice", {"Bob": "C"})
['D']

The project intentionally keeps the implementation light‑weight while still
providing type hints and thorough documentation so the engine can be readily
extended for more sophisticated game‑theoretic analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    players:
        Ordered sequence of players participating in the game.
    strategies:
        Mapping from each player to the strategies available to them.

    -----
    The class performs minimal validation – it verifies that all players have
    strategies defined and that payoff entries match the number of players.
